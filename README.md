# ZenGarden: theme 'StarWars'
ZenGarden is a challenge to style a single page of HTML using only CSS.
I demonstrated what can be accomplished through CSS-based design using my son's favorite theme.
 * Using: Sass, Flexbox, Grid, Shapes, Animations, and Transitions
 * Animation for title, background and footer.
 * Hover effect for main items and footer.
 * Shadow effect for 'introducion'.
 * Borders and shadow effect for summary and preamble.
 * The 'Introducing' is rounded (I didn't round anymore because StarWars is square).
 * Inserted content (my name) in the header using header::after{content:...
 * In the main, there are an animation pulsing shadow (in the rectangles).
 * The siderbar is hide for small devices.
 * Responsive with 5 breakpoints, from extra small devices through extra large devices.
 * I chose images, colors and font in tune with my theme.
